Subject: Predictive Asthma Modeling
Members: Daida, K., Petrov, A., Ryuzaki, Y.

Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to use factors, such as Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and environmental indices, such as air quality, to predict asthma prevalence in communities at the census tract level. Datasets include:
- [CDC PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/index.html) for asthma prevalence and other health outcomes. 
- [Social Vulnerability Index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) for socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial or ethnic minority status, housing type and transportation, and other social determinants of health. 
- [Air Quality System (AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) for air quality and other environmental factors.
